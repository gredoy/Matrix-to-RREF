# Matrix to RREF   
Python code that inputs a matrix.txt, finds the Row-Reduced Echelon Form and outputs all the necessary steps in compilable LaTeX source code.

It can even handle (to some extent) variables as co-efficients in systems of linear equations.
The compilable latex code is currently printed into a RREF.txt and displays every Elementary Row Operation taken to reduce the matrix.
